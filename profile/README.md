Libraries and software for creating applications with bitcoin protocol.

Main projects:
- **[BP Primitives]**: bitcoin consensus-level data types and structures (transactions, blocks etc);
- **[BP Core]**: client-side-valdiation with bitcoin ([deterministic bitcoin commitments][dbc] and [signle-use-seal][seals]);
- **[BP Wallet]**: Modern, lightweight, standard-compliant read-only wallet library without rust-bitcoin/miniscript dependencies
- **[BP Tools]**: Bitcoin protocol command-line wallet & tools 
- **[BP Node]**: efficient indexing bitcoin node written in rust (electum server replacement);
